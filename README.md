# Spotify_Hit_Track_Prediction
Music has a always played an important role in people's daily life. In addition, as mobile and app technology thrive, more and more artists rely heavily on music streaming platforms, such as Spotify. As a music lover, I am really curious about nowadays music listeners' taste and preference. Hence, I create a prediction model that could accurately predict whether the track is going to be a hit track based on various musical characteristic, using the Spotify dataset from Kaggle.
