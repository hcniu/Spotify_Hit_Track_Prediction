# Spotify_Hit_Track_Prediction
Music has a always played an important role in people's daily life. In addition, as mobile and app technology thrive, more and more artists rely heavily on music streaming platforms, such as Spotify. As a music lover, I am really curious about nowadays music listeners' taste and preference. Hence, I create a prediction model that could accurately predict whether the track is going to be a hit track based on various musical characteristic, using the Spotify dataset from Kaggle.   
   
In this project, I try various popular ensamble models, such as Random Forest, XGBoost, LighGBM. Besides, to select model, I use Nested Random Search CV to find the best performing method. Eventually, I use Random Search CV to find the best parameters. If you have any question, feel free to contact me via my linkedin in my profile.
